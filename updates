			<div class="content">
				<h4>Updated Sidebar</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We've finally updated the left sidebar as it was getting too cluttered.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Edit Panel</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We've moved the config primarily to the MySQL database to allow for easy editing. An issue currently known is that permissions and buttons don't save correctly. They are stored in serialed PHP array in the database if someone wishes to manually change them. The permission to edit the staff panel config is 'editpanel'.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Tables! Tables! Tables!</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We've changed most of the HTML tables to a sortable, pagination-able, searchable table system. This allows you to change the sorting on certain pages to show highest ping, alphabetical, or other options.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Players List</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						You now have the ability to view all players including disconnected players. This retired the old player search method.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Warning List</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						You are now able to view a list of all warnings.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Kicks List</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						You are now able to view a list of all kicks.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Bans List</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						You are now able to view a list of all bans.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Playtime Statistics</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						Your dashboard now shows playtime statistics of all users in minutes, hours, days, and years.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Prepairing for v1.0</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						Sorry for the delay in updates, I've been busy with life recently and haven't had much time to do any development. We are still on track for v1.0 in Q1 of 2018 (Maybe at the turn of the year).

				<h4>Recently Connected Players</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We have added the ability to view recently connected players. The time limit can be configured from your site config.php file.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Trust Score Command</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						Users can now check their own playtime and trust score by typing "/trustscore PLAYERID" in the server chat. This will return the name, playtime, and trust score of the player id to every player.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Per Admin Statistics</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						Staff with the permission "editstaff" now have the ability to view specific staff members statistics. You can do so by clicking their name in the Edit Staff section. This provides all-time and weekly stats as well as shows a record of their actions.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Server Buttons</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We've edited the way server buttons work. We've now added functionality to run commands instead of command specific buttons. We have also added a kick for staff button which kicks the most recently connected player. You can see the example in the updated config.php
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Optimization</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We have removed useless code along with optimizing database queries and a few other things that we are forgetting about.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Prepairing for v1.0</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						As we've lerked for over 3 months doing edits and failing to publish them as we felt it wasn't a big enough contribution we has final decided to start working on version 1.0, the first official release.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Plugin System</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We're glad to announce that we've release a plugin system. To find plugins developed by the team visit <a href="https://github.com/CADOJRP/FiveM-AdministrationPanel-Plugins">https://github.com/CADOJRP/FiveM-AdministrationPanel-Plugins</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Chat Commands</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						You're now able to warn, kick, and ban using in-game commands. Running the command will check the users permissions before taking action.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Removing Records</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We have finally added the ability for staff to remove warns, kicks and bans from a players profile.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Back End Stuff</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We're continuing to work hard to improve our panel. With the new Plugins System we will start focusing on other unique features such as vRP and ESX support. 
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Analytics</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						In the recent updates we've been working to add tracking to our software. The reason for this is it allows us to access your GET API Endpoints and we're able to use that information to make plugins such as a Global Ban, global time tracking, records on other servers, etc. To disable panel tracking change "analytics" to false in your config file.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We've squashed a lot of bugs. Many bugs centered around errors and timeouts. We can't thank the beta testers enough for helping us find these.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Permissions</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						The permissions system has been released. The current permissions used by the system are warn, kick, ban, editstaff and editservers. More will be coming in the future such as unban, permban, tempban, etc.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Discord Webhooks</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						We've finished the Discord webhook system. This will allow you to have a Discord chat that will message every time someone gets warned, kicked, or banned.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Join Message</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						Join messages are now supported. The default join message is "Username is joining the server with 75% trust score." This message by default won't look the best because the default chat resource already provides join messages and puts <b>server:</b> infront of our messages. This is an easy fix. Join our Discord for help.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Edit Staff</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						You're now able to add and remove staff from a menu! If you have the "editstaff" permission you can click the Edit Staff button on the left side of the screen and explore the menu.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Edit Servers</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						You're now able to add and remove servers from a menu! If you have the "editservers" permission you can click the Edit Servers button on the left side of the screen and explore the menu.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h4>Installer Changes</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 14px;">
				</p><ul>
					<li>
						Sadly we've had to remove the installer as it was too unreliable and had too many expoits.
					</li>
				</ul>
